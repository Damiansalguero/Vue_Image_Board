## Next steps part 2:



1. ~~add Amazon URL + filename~~ 

2. ~~INSERT INTO images the description, username, title, and Amazon URL + filename~~

    

3. ~~Now to get the images to show up onscreen WITHOUT refreshing...~~

4. ~~send response back to the front (back to `then` of axios)~~

5. ~~once we're back in Vue-land, we need to take the image that was just uploaded and add it to the images array created in part 1.~~

   1. ~~(hint: this can be accomplished with `push` and `unshift`)~~

6. ~~once you've done these steps you should see newly uploaded images show up on screen WITHOUT refreshing.~~
