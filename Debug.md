# Debug

### debugging

1. Should I fix this bug right now? (priority)
   - Fatal Bugs - bugs that break your site (high priority)
   - less fatal - things that are inconvenient but don't break the code (lower priority)
   - you won't have time for everything
2. read the error message
   - note where the error message appeared
     - in dev tools -> frontend issue
     - terminal -> backend
3.  pinpoint scope of your error
   - what I think would happen?
   - What actually happend
4. sometimes you'll have to get frustrated and bang your head against for a bit (that's part of the process)
5. Ask peers for help
   - the obvious hope is that your peer can spot the bug and tell you how to fix it
   - rubber duck
6. Ask your teacher
   - have everything open and and running, have ATOM open, have your server running, bring any extra things you need (diagrams)
   - spend a few minutes thinking about the bug and how to formulate your question
     - "It broke" is not a good statement
   - demo the bug for us
