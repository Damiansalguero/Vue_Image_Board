# Next Steps Part 1

### db stuff 

1. ~~create new database for image board project~~

2. ~~set up spicedPg~~ 

3. ~~run images.sql file~~ 

  

### vue and index

1. ~~create the main screen~~

   - #main (id)

2. create a `Vue` instance

   - when it mounts make an ajax request

     - in mounted — axios request to server to get images from db 
     - in mounted — put images array in data object 

   - HTML template should loop through them a

   - render

     - to tell Vue that the src attribute of the img tag is reactive — in other words, a variable — you'll need to use the following syntax: `<img :src = "someVar.someProp" >`
